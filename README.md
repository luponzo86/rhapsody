# Rhapsody
Python program, based on ProDy, for pathogenicity prediction of human
missense variants. 

The code of conduct is the same as for ProDy (https://github.com/prody/ProDy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Install latest published version using pip
Rhapsody is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). To install Rhapsody,
please use pip in the terminal:
```console
$ pip install -U prody-rhapsody
```
It might be necessary to manually install the DSSP program, for instance
by typing on Linux:
```console
$ sudo apt install dssp
```

## Install from source
Rhapsody is written in pure Python so no local compilation is needed.

To install all needed dependencies, we strongly suggest to use Conda and create
a new environment with:
```console
$ conda create -n rhapsody python=3 numpy scikit-learn requests pyparsing matplotlib biopython
$ conda activate rhapsody
$ pip install prody
$ conda install -c salilab dssp
```

After cloning/forking the Rhapsody repository, you can permanently add the
repository path to the conda environment with:
```console
$ conda develop path/to/local/repository
```

If not using Conda, you can manually install all dependencies and then add
the repository location to the `PYTHONPATH` environmental variable. For
example, on Linux simply add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:
```console
export PYTHONPATH="path/to/local/repository/:$PYTHONPATH"
```

If you are running on Windows, please follow this
[tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4855685).

## Running initial setup

After installation, please run:
```console
import rhapsody as rd
rd.initialSetup()
```
